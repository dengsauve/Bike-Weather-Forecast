## Updates

### March 22, 2019
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) seems to provide all the information I require, free of charge. Similar limitations to Wunderground, but lower resolution (3 hour intervals on weather data as opposed to hourly). I don't think the limitations of OpenWeatherMap will reduce the usability of this tool.

### Early March, 2019
Weather Underground has removed their free weather API. I plan to rebuild based on an available weather API.

For more information about Wunderground's API, see [End of Service for the Weather Underground API](https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/end-of-service-for-the-weather-underground-api)
